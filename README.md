# jamilbot
My private "Online Classroom" Discord Bot written in Python.
I have changed the token so no one could access my bot, but feel free to reuse my code!
There's a pdf writeup file named [ClassBot.pdf](https://github.com/JamilHaidar/jamilbot/files/10801552/ClassBot.pdf) that showcases some capabilities of the bot and usecases.
